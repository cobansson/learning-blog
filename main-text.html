                       I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                       of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <h1>How I stay committed to learning</h1>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                        then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>

                    <h1>How I got started</h1>

                    <p>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                        short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting 
                        my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
